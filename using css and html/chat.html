        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The future is always a topic of interest and speculation. From new technologies to shifting social norms, the future holds endless possibilities and potential for change. This web page explores some of the predictions and potential impacts of the future on society.
		   Future is uncertain, yet we all make plans for the coming days and years that we have ahead of us.
           Though we have no idea as to what may happen tomorrow or the every next second, we make huge plans and build great dreams for our future.
           Sometimes we achieve them and at other times it just stays as dreams which may go unfulfilled.</p>

		<h2>Why do we dream out future?</h2>
		<p>Everybody would love to have secure future like a happy home, good living conditions and a great life. In order to achieve all these, people start making plans like investments, savings and planning on many small and big agendas for a smooth and secure life. When planning’s made, lot of thought process goes into it and lots of hard work too. Each one of us dream to have a secure and stable future and the race for the same just goes on. The only difference being that the race differs from person to person and not the reason.
           However, though we all make plans for our future, some succeed, while some don’t make it. There is no secret formula for success, but the only thing that you need to do is, dream and never to give up. Keep trying till you reach the destination that you have set up for yourself. As long as you don’t reach there, never turn back. As future is totally unpredictable, sometime, in spite of all this hard work, results may appear to take centuries to happen. But still at the end you would get for what you have put in.</p>
